        print("second")
    assert 0  # to see what was printed


# Letâ€™s run this without supplying our new option:
# $ pytest -q test_sample1.py

# And now run this with supplying a command line option:
# $ pytest -q --cmdopt=type2 test_sample1.py
# You can see that the command line option arrived in our test.
