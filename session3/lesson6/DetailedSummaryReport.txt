Detailed summary report
The -r flag can be used to display a “short test summary info” at the end of the test session, 
making it easy in large test suites to get a clear picture of all failures, skips, xfails, etc.

It defaults to fE to list failures and errors.

The -r options accepts a number of characters after it, with a used above meaning “all except passes”.
Here is the full list of available characters that can be used:
f - failed
E - error
s - skipped
x - xfailed
X - xpassed
p - passed
P - passed with output

Special characters for (de)selection of groups:
a - all except pP
A - all
N - none, this can be used to display nothing (since fE is the default)

More than one character can be used, so for example to only see failed and skipped tests, you can execute:
$ pytest -rfs
$ pytest -ra
